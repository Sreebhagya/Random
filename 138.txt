A kind of toll. In the past, the term octroi was used to refer to the toll or duty levied on liquor and other goods brought into a city for the consumption of its inhabitants, with the permission of the ruler or governor who ruled over it. The word is derived from the word octoier, which means to allow and empower.
Octaroy was initially charged only at ports. However, as the tariff became more lucrative, it became known as the City Toll, which was imposed on goods brought within the city limits. Gradually, octroys became the norm for goods carried out of the city. It was also known as the In Gate Toll as it was levied at the city gates and at the city limits. In the early days, tariffs were levied only on goods brought for public consumption. Over time, however, tariffs were imposed without reference to consumption. Today, Octoy is charging to increase revenue for local self-government institutions. Such institutions have little power to impose indirect taxes.
