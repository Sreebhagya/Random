Bengal is a region comprising Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. Bengali is the common language of the people of these two regions.
In 1905, the British divided Bengal into West and East Bengal, but reunited in 1911. After independence in 1947, East Bengal became known as East Pakistan as part of Pakistan. Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 with the help of India.
During the Mughal rule, Bengal was an important region under their control. Murshid Khili Khan, who was appointed by the Mughals as the Naib of the Province of Bengal, ie Subadar's aide, seized power from the Mughals.
