Icadipets salasi are the largest penguins in the tropics of South America during the last period of the Eocene. The word Ika is derived from the Peruvian region where the remains of this creature were found, the Greek translation of the word Dipets is the name of the diver, and the word Salasi is derived from the name of the ancient biologist Rodolfo. The study, led by Julia Clark, a biologist and professor at the University of North Carolina, found the remains of a penguin 36 million years ago off the coast of Peru. It is the third largest penguin ever found.
