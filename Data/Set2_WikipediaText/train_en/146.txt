The Intelligence Division is an internal intelligence agency operating under the Ministry of Home Affairs. India's IB is the world's first intelligence agency. The IB is tasked with secretly gathering information about destructive activities inside India and other things that the government needs to know. It is estimated that there are about 25,000 officers serving in the IB.
The Central Intelligence Agency was established in 1947 under the auspices of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, but the first form of intelligence in British India was established in 1885. Major General Sir Charles McGregor was the head of this intelligence unit of the British Indian Army based in Shimla. It was established in the 19th century to monitor Russian military deployments in Afghanistan due to fears that Russia might invade British India.
In 1909, the British authorities realized that the Indian independence movement was gaining strength and set up the Indian Political Intelligence Office in England to monitor it. From 1921 onwards, the institute came to be known as the Indian Political Intelligence Service. The Indian political intelligence service was run by the British Indian Office and the then Government of India. The IPI had close ties to Scotland Yard and MI5 in the UK.
