This is a dilemma of the famous linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure found that the interrelationships between symbols or words in language exist on two levels. He calls them the integrative level and the analogy level. At the level of similarity is the relationship between structurally similar words such as nouns, pronouns, and verbs. There are many similarities between the terms river, river, ocean, and lake. These can be used interchangeably when it comes to a sentence. It can be said that there is a structural similarity between these terms as they can be written as river dry and sea dry. In English, articles a, an and the are the same set of terms, but there are conditions for selection. This is called the vertical plane of the linguistic structure, as the linguistic elements on the similar level can be stacked one on top of the other. The level of integration is the level at which language components can only be connected linearly and sequentially. Symbols are linked to the front and back in this horizontal position of the language. In language, it is called curiosity, spelling and grammar. It is a concept commonly referred to as word level and grammar level. The system of language is formed by the interrelationship at the level of similarity and at the level of integration. A valid linguistic structure is formed by selection from the analogy level and integration at the integrative level. However, in each language there are integrated restrictions on this selection and addition.
