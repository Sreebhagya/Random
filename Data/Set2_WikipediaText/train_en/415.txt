The Angel was an English gold coin introduced by Edward IV in 1465. It was designed after the French Angelot or Ang and was distributed from 1340. The name is derived from the fact that Archangel Michael dismembered a dragon. It is considered to be a new issue of the first English gold coin, the Noble. It was also called the Angel Noble.
