Sexual intercourse is the mental and physical act of preparing a partner for maximum sexual arousal. This is an unavoidable stage before sex. Having sex without spending enough time on outdoor play can lead to dissatisfaction. Sexual intercourse is also considered an expression of love. Outdoor play includes sweet talk, sexual intercourse, kissing, hugging, and touching. Touching and caressing the body parts like the lips, ears and neck of the spouse is a foregone conclusion. In women, external play involves gentle caressing of the nerve endings, such as the cruciate ligament. The nervous system and the brain play a role in this pleasure.  
Exciting outdoor play stimulates and prepares the body and mind for sex. This increases the blood flow to the genitals and vagina. The result is a quote from a tired male. In women, the vagina develops and "lubricating secretions" are produced, citing the clitoris. This leads to comfortable sex. In the absence of lubrication secretions, sexual intercourse can be boring or painful for women and can be stressful for men. This is where the importance of orgasm comes into play. But methods that the partner is not interested in should be avoided.      
Because orgasm occurs later in women than in men, and because sexual arousal lasts longer, engaging in outdoor sex can help prolong sexual intercourse and counteract men's 'lack of time'. Some studies have shown that it can also be used to improve the quality of male sperm. Some studies suggest that spending at least 20 minutes on premarital sex is good for a happy sex life. Sexual intercourse may take longer to stimulate, especially for first-timers, postmenopausal women, and older men. Prolonged outdoor play can help relieve vaginal dryness and contact pain. Artificial moisturizing lubricants can also be used. Innovative outdoor games will eliminate repetitive boredom in sex. Studies show that women of all genders are more likely to enjoy outdoor sports than women in general. The clean and fragrant atmosphere is perfect for this. Many species, such as snakes, spend a lot of time having sex.  
The brain is the source of sexual arousal. Preliminaries are needed to increase this stimulus. Avoiding stress can help you enjoy outdoor activities. But asexual individuals belonging to sexual minorities may not have sexual interest or sometimes sexual ability. For those with this feature, engaging in outdoor activities alone will not result in sexual arousal.
