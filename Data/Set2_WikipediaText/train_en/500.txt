The fact that any integer can be written as the sum of four integers is called Lagrange's quadratic quotient or Bashe conjugation. That is, if p {\ displaystyle p is an integer
There are integers a 0, a 1, a 2, a 3 {\ displaystyle a_ {0}, a_ {1}, a_ {2}, a_ {3} രിക്കുന്ന according to the equation. For example, the numbers 3, 31, 310 can be written as the sum of the four integers:
This resolution was proved by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1770, and the resolution is named after him.
The examples in Arithmetica show that Diophantus was aware of this theme. In 1621, Bashe translated the book into Latin and recorded the theme in his notes. But this was first proved by Lagrange in 1770.
In 1797, Adrian-Marie Leshandru invented three class themes and developed Lagrange's theorems. This resolution states that integers that can be written as exactly 4 k {\ displaystyle 4 ^ {k can be written as the sum of three integers. Later, in 1834, Carl Gustab Jacob Jacobi invented the formula for giving the number of ways in which an integer can be written as the sum of four integers, known as Jacobi's quadratic theorem.
Lagrange's resolution is also related to the Descartes theme, which connects the radii of four circles touching each other. It is associated with Apollonian gaskets and the Ramanujan-Peterson conjector.
Lagrange's resolution is typical of Fermat's polygonal resolution and Waring's problem. The resolution can also be generalized in this way: Suppose the number a, b, c, d {\ displaystyle a, b, c, d are given. For any value of n {\ displaystyle n
Is it possible to find the integers x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 {\ displaystyle x_ {1}, x_ {2}, x_ {3}, x_ {4} രിക്കുന്ന according to the equation? Lagrange's resolution states that this is possible when a = b = c = d = 1 \ displaystyle a = b = c = d = 1. The general conclusion was found by Ramanujan. a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d {\ displaystyle a \ leq b \ leq c \ leq d} x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4 {\ displaystyle x_} for any n {\ displaystyle n Ramanujan proved that there are 54 a, b, c, d {\ displaystyle a, b, c, d} values ​​that can be found in 1}, x_ {2}, x_ {3}, x_ {4.
