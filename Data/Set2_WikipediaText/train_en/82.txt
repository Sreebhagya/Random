Yayati is the king mentioned in the Puranas and the son of Nahushanu born in Ashokasundari. Father of Yadu and Puru. Yayati, a Vedic scholar, had two wives, Devyani and Sharmishtha. Devyani was the daughter of Shukracharya, the guru of the demons. Sharmishtha was the daughter of the demon king Vrishaparva. Sharmishtha was Devyani's companion.
Yadu and Turvvasu are the children of Yayati in Devyani.
Druhyu, Anu and Puru are the children of Yayati Sharmistha.
Devyani was secretly unaware that Yayati had married Sharmishtha. When it was discovered, Venus angrily cursed Yayati. The curse was that Yayati should lose her youth. Venus later said that if anyone was willing to leave their youth with Yayati, Yayati would get his Yavati back. Yayati called the children one by one and asked them to give them their youth. Only Puru is ready for this. Yayati got the youth of Puru. After the time of Yayati, Puru ruled the country.
