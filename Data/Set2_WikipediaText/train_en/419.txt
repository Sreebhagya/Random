Hamadi Jabali is the former Prime Minister of Tunisia. He resigned in February 2013 after his party, Annahda, did not approve plans to form a new coalition government.
Hamadi Jabali was born in 1949 in the city of Susa. He graduated from Tunis and Paris. Jabali is a former journalist and solar engineer. Sentenced to death in 1987 under dictator Habib Bourgeois. He fled to Spain and escaped and was imprisoned for one and a half years during the reign of Zainul Abidin bin Ali. Annahda is one of the founders of the party.
Unemployment, rising inflation and declining tourism revenues have hit the country's economy hard. Leading Left leader Shukri Bilaid has been shot dead amid opposition allegations that the government is not taking strong action against inflation and religious extremism. The government's image has been tarnished by the inability to apprehend anyone in connection with this. To address this, Jabali decided to dissolve the current political government and form a new government consisting of technical experts. Jabali resigned after this was rejected by the Annahda party and its allies.
