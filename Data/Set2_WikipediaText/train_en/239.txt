Four, all classed as Least Concern
Honey creepers are one of the most unique birds in the Hawaiian Islands. They are also found in areas from Mexico to Brazil.
Honey creepers vary in the shape of their beaks and the color of their feathers. These belong to the genus Cyanerpes. They are available in red, green, yellow and blue. Some have parrot-like beaks. This causes the seeds to crack and eat. Most honey creepers drink nectar from flowers with long curved beaks.
It was initially believed that they lay black eggs. Studies since the 1940s have disproved that belief. 
There are four types of birds in this genus.
