A system for embedding or separating what is embedded in another network protocol within a computer network protocol. Tunneling allows the transmission of messages, signals, etc. across different computer networks or systems.
Tunneling is implemented in each network in different ways depending on the structure of the network. For example, in Apple Talk, a router with the Apple Talk update-routing protocol tunnels the Apple Talk packets into TCP / IP packets and then transmits them to another router with AURP via TCP / IP. After the router removes the IP and AURP headers, the packets are sent to their original address. A router that operates on a driver in an IP tunnel / IP on NetWare's Internet Network Packet Exchange protocol transmits IPX packets to UDP / IP through tunneling. Content in packets and IP addresses. Tunnel / IP Transfer TCP / IP to another network running on. Sending via. Then the second router IP, UDP.
