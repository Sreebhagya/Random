Phenolic resins are one of the first man-made polymers to hit the market. They belong to the category of thermosetting plastics. Backlight was the first item. In July 1907, a scientist named Backland patented it. This resin is the result of a very complex chemical reaction with phenol and formaldehyde.
The first step is to form a phenolic molecule with three formaldehyde molecules to form a methyllol product. The second step is to dissolve the methyl and phenol in water molecules and combine them into methylene groups. The two methylols .. Although groups can be combined through ether links, they separate and again become methylene bonds. The regenerated formaldehyde is chemically reactivated.
The characteristics of the final product depend on the ratio of phenol to formaldehyde and whether the chemical reaction is in the presence of acid or alkali.
Nockolac was the first name given to backlight and backlight. He was trying to find a substance similar to shellac. Novolac is a long chain obtained by using the acid as a catalyst and the formaldehyde phenol ratio as less than one. Due to the low content of formaldehyde, only one methyl group is obtained for each phenol molecule. It is fastened with hexa methylene tetramine.
Resol is produced when the alkaline chemical catalyst and the formaldehyde phenol ratio are more than one. As the network builds, loops may fall.
