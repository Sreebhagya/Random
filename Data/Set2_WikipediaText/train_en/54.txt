Khustian Nuru National Park is a national park in Mongolia, located in the province of Tow. This national park is also known as Hustai National Park. The Tool River flows through the national park. In 1993, the Mongolian government declared Husta National Park a special protected area. This was a year after the announcement of the Hustain Nururu Redistribution Project for the exiled Takhi horses. Khustian Nuru National Park, through the Khenti Mountains, covers the area to the western end of the Mongolian steppe, bordering Altanbulag, Argaland, and Biancangai Soms in Tow province. This national park is located at a distance of 100 km from the western capital city of Ulabaster.
