The great poet Changampuzha stands apart from other Malayalam poets as a human being and as a poet. This beloved poet of Malayalam was born on October 10, 1911. His birthplace is Edappally in North Travancore. His mother is Mrs. Parukuttyamma of Edappally Changampuzha Tharavat. Raman Menon's father at Thekkedathu house.
Born into a poor family, Changampuzha had a difficult childhood education. He completed his high school education at Edappally Malayalam Primary School, Sreekrishnavilas English Medium School, Aluva St. Mary's School, Ernakulam Government High School and St. Albert's School. Edappally Raghavan Pillai, his friend and one of the founders of the Edappally movement, a poet, committed suicide at the end of his high school education. This incident deeply touched the life of Changampuzha. This incident inspired him to write the lament 'Ramanan'. That work became very popular in Malayalam.
He studied at the Maharaja's College, Ernakulam and later at the Arts College, Thiruvananthapuram, graduating with honors. Changampuzha became a famous poet while studying at Maharaja's College. Many famous works were published that day. He once married Sridevi Amma before the end of his education. After completing his studies, he went to military service due to financial difficulties. He did not stay there long. He resigned after two years and joined the Law College in Madras. However, he returned home without completing his studies.
Many of the works that later led Changampuzha to the pinnacle of fame were written during this period. In the meantime, he worked as a member of the editorial board of Mangalodayam magazine. He then immersed himself in writing and his family lived in Edappally.
His later life underwent many anxious changes. He contracted rheumatism first and then tuberculosis. The great poet, who was eager to enjoy life in spite of anything, was on the verge of death. The days did not move much. He passed away on the afternoon of June 17, 1948 at the Mangalodayam Nursing Home in Thrissur, leaving the entire world of friendship in Kerala in mourning. He was only 37 at the time. He was buried in his hometown of Edappally. In his memory, the Changampuzha Cultural Society, Kalavedi, Changampuzha Memorial Library and Park have been established at Edappally. Every year various art events are organized in the memory of Changampuzha.
Changampuzha Kairali has published fifty-seven works, including collections of poems, poems, translations and novels. Joseph Mundasseri may have described him as a 'love star of the stars', perhaps because of his beautiful poetry.
Unlike his other works, 'Vazhakula' calls for a response to social inequalities.

The book on astrology written by Changampuzha was not published and its manuscript was found in the possession of Edakattu Narayanan, an astrologer and writer from Kannur. He wrote this book in 1945 using ancient mathematics. It is believed that the book was handed over to Iyunni, a native of Changampuzha, Thrissur, for publication and he handed it over to Narayanan.
