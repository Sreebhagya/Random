Axiothia was a student of Fleus Plato and Sphusipus. 
She was born in Fl‡µÅs, an ancient city in the Peloponnese. Plato started his academy when the city was under Spartan rule. Themistius told Axiotia to read Plato's Republic and to go to Athens to be his student. She disguised herself as a man and studied at the academy. After Plato's death, they continued their research with Plato's nephew, Sphuscipus.
Part of a papyrus from Oxyrhynchus refers to an unknown woman who studied under Plato, Sphyps, and Menedemus of Eretria. This passage goes on to describe "among the Kumaras they were loving and full of unknown little kindness". This woman may be Axiothea or Lasthenia of Mantinea.
