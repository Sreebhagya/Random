Ghosh was a philosopher of ancient India. Ghosh was the granddaughter of a long-haired man and the wife of a client. Both of them have written hymns in praise of Ashwini Kumaran.
Verses 39 and 40 of the 10th volume of the Rig Veda are believed to have been composed by Ghosh. The first verse praises the gods Ashwini. The second verse deals with personal desires for marriage.
According to this verse, Ghosh was a leper. The ugliness caused by this also affected the noise. As they got older, the Ashwini boys cured the disease and gave Ghosh health, youth and beauty. Following this, Ghosh was able to get married.
