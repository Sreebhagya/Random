Yttrium is an element with atomic number 39. Y is its symbol in the periodic table. It is a silver colored transition element. This metal is found in most rare earth minerals. Its two compounds are used to make red phosphorus in the cathode ray tubes used in televisions.
Yttrium is a rare earth metal with a metallic-silver color and luster. It bears a striking resemblance to Scandia. Chemically similar to lanthanides. It glows a little pink when exposed to light. This metal residue, which is used after construction, burns itself in air when the temperature rises above 400 C. Accurately divided yttrium is unstable in air. Normally its oxidation state is +3.
The most important yttrium compound is yttrium oxide. It is widely used to make VO4: Eu and Y2O3: Eu phosphors, which give the pitcher tube of a television a red color. Other uses:
