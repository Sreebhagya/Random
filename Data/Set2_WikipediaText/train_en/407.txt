Endangered species. This category includes species that become extinct due to changes in habitat, predation, hunting, or other causes. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 2006 species account for 40% of all species. Many countries have enacted laws to protect endangered species. For example, the Prohibition of Hunting and the Prohibition of Construction Activities in Their Habitat, for example, protected land and the Periyar Tiger Reserve.
Considered to be the largest living creature in the world, blue whales can grow up to 33 meters in length and weigh more than 181 metric tons. The body of blue whales is long, bluish gray, and the underside of the body is pale. These are again thought to have at least three species. BM found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Musculus, BM found in the South Seas. Intermedia and the dwarf blue whale found in the Indian Ocean. B.M. in the Indian Ocean. Indica may be a subspecies. Like other baleen whales, blue whales feed only on crustaceans, which are small crustaceans.
Before the beginning of whaling, blue whales were abundant in almost all oceans until the beginning of the twentieth century. They were found in large numbers in the Antarctic. Up to approximately 2,39,000. Over the next forty years, whalers hunted them extensively and brought them to the brink of extinction. In 1966, the international community came out against it and banned the hunting of blue whales. According to a 2002 estimate, between 5,000 and 12,000 blue whales remain in groups of five in the world today. However, later studies suggest that this figure is much lower. Today there are only about 2,000 groups in the Antarctic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. There are two groups of whales in the Atlantic Ocean.
