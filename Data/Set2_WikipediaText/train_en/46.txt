Tapas is a time of fasting in preparation for Easter, according to the liturgical year of the Western Church. The period of tapas is observed for about six weeks before Easter. The period of tapas is from Vibhuti Wednesday to Passover Thursday or the evening before Easter. It is a time of repentance, atonement and repentance for the believers. Believers observe Lent through fasting, abstinence, abstinence from meat, and abstinence from luxuries. In Kerala, this fasting period is known as the Fifty Fasts and the Great Fast.
The Latin word quadrazzema is used for tapas. This word means fortieth. In Malayalam, it is known as the Fifty Fasts, but in fact it is a forty day long period.
When arguing with Jesus about fasting, Jesus' response, referring to his coming tribulation, was, "The time will come when the bridegroom will depart from them, and then they will fast."
 Violet or purple is the color of worship during tapas. The altar curtains, the glass of the altar lamps, the door curtains, the sacramental curtains, and the robes worn by the workers will be in violet. The prayers of Gloria and Tedovum and the Hallelujah in the hymns are omitted during this period. However, Gloria sings during the festive season.
The Way of the Cross is the main prayer offered by the believers during tapas. This is a prayer that remembers the sufferings of Jesus. Believers in Kerala recite Puthan Pana during this period. Christian marriage is not permissible these days.
The last week of Tapas is celebrated as Holy Week. From Oshana Sunday to Good Friday evening, the crucifixes will be covered with violet or purple cloth.
