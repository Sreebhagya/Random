Chaturaji is a chess-like game that can be played by four people. The game was first described by al-Bayruni. AD In the book India in 1030. Unlike modern chess, the moves of the calves are determined by the rotation of the two dice. The dice-free variant of the game existed in India in the late nineteenth century.
As shown in the picture, Chaturaji plays with different colored calves. Each player has 4 calves in the last rank and 4 calves in the second rank just before that. The four rank-and-file are the king, the elephant, the horse, and the boat. The king moves like a king in chess, the elephant moves like a chariot in chess and the horse moves like a horse in chess. The boat moves like an elephant in chess, but like the alpine in Shatranj, there are obstacles to long-distance movement. The boat moves at two angles, jumping over the next row in any direction.
