St. John of Egypt is a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. Until the age of twenty-five, he lived as a carpenter, subject to his father. John was characterized by obedience, humility, and self-love. The main theme of John 's speeches was against the evil of boasting.
When Palladius, a monk, visited John, he prophesied that Palladius would become bishop. But he was in charge of the kitchen of the monastery and did not care, but years later Palladius became bishop. Later, John made another prophecy about the military victory of Theodosius I.
At the end of sixteen years of training, John was at the top of a hill with divine thoughts. John received the gift of prophecy and healing through constant divine union. Heartfelt knowledge was his special achievement. At the monastery door, John preached the gospel every week. Through this the people received repentance and healing.
A.D. He died in 394. He died on his knees praying.
