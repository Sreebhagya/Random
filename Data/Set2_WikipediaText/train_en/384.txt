Set is one of the basic concepts in mathematics. Mathematical theory is a highly advanced and under research subject. The theory of computation was developed by George Cantor.
The set was defined by George Cantor. In his opinion it is "a set of members that can be clearly defined." Its members can be zodiac signs, objects or ideas.
The set is denoted by uppercase letters of the English alphabet. The group members are defined in brackets. The alignment of members is mainly indicated in 3 ways.
The symbol ∈ or is used to indicate whether or not you belong to a given zodiac sign.
For example, consider the arithmetic array N N \ displaystyle \ mathbb {N}.
Therefore N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb N}} = {1,2,3,4, ..........} here 100∈ N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb {N}} and 0 ∉ N \ displaystyle \ mathbb is also N.
The number of members in a set is called the set number of that set | With the symbol.
In the example above, the set number N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb {N മാണ് is infinite. Considering the set A = {1,2,3,4 is | A | = 4.
A subset is a group of members who are fully or partially members of a set. സൂചിപ്പ {\ displaystyle \ subseteq
   Considering the set N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb N}, the set A = {2,4,6,8 ..........} is a subset of N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb {N.
That is, A {{\ displaystyle \ subseteq} N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb {N}} and vice versa N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb N}. N {\ displaystyle \ mathbb {N}} ⊇ display \ displaystyle \ supseteq} A
All members of two or more groups are grouped together. All members of the group are grouped together into one group.
The meeting of two groups A and B is referred to as A ∪ B. Its members can be either A or B members.
The terms can be expressed as A ∪ B = {x / x∈ A or x∈B} Examples:
A set of common members of two or more groups is obtained by the combination of two groups. The combination of two groups A and B is denoted as A ∩ B.
The terms can be expressed as: A .B = {x / x∈ A and x∈B} Examples:
Observes the law of circumstance. A ∩ = ∩ C
The set of members that are in the whole set and not in the given set is called the complement set.
Conditional terms can be expressed as: A '= {x / x∉A
A regular pair is a set of numbers. Denotes a sequence of pairs where a represents the first and b the second numbers. = Denotes a = a 'and b = b'.
This is the main difference between the pair and the set. That is, the pair is used to align the numbers in a certain order. But such an order is not required in the set. And ഗണ a and a ഗണ in the set are meaningless. But refers to a meaningful pair.
The Cartesian multiplier is used to combine members of one group with members of another to form a new set. The two groups A and B are recorded as regular pairs. AXB indicates. Can be defined in terms of terms.
AXB = {/ x∈ A, y∈ B
Group A has m members and group B has n members and group AXB has mXn members.
