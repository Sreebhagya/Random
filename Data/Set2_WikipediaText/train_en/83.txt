The Shanmukhi Alphabet is a Persian-Arabic alphabet used by the Muslims of Punjab to write the Punjabi language. Shanmukhi literally means from the mouth of the king. It is written in the Nastaliq style of Persian calligraphy. Persian and Arabic scripts are also written in Punjabi in the Gurmukhi style. Gurmukhi is the most widely used script for writing the Punjabi language. Shanmukhi was originally written by Sufi poets in Punjab. After the independence of India in 1947, Muslims in the Punjab province of Pakistan followed this traditional style of writing.
