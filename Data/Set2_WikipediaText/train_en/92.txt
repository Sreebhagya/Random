Lakshmi is a fungal disease that affects rice. It is also known as varicose veins. Symptoms include invading the nostrils and turning them into ball-like spheres containing yellow fungal fibers instead of bells. The ancients said that Lakshmi disease is caused due to overflowing of milk in the paddy when the rice is harvested. Since it is common to see this disease in a few ears in some continents during the harvest season, there is a belief among the farmers that the yield will increase when the disease comes. This disease causes a decrease in the weight of the ripe grains. Seed germination from these will be less. Relative humidity above 90% and temperatures of 25-35ÂºC are more likely to cause this disease.
The main symptom is the formation of round yellow bells on the stalks of paddy. They look like gold bells and have a yellow powder on top. Rainfall, high humidity and high nitrogen content in the soil are favorable for the disease. Wind helps the germs of this fungal disease to spread from one plant to another. The disease affects the plant during the flowering stage.
