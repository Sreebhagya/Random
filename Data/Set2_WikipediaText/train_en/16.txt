August Roden was a French sculptor. Roden was initially criticized for rejecting a style that saw sculptures only as ornaments. His work is one of the most famous sculptures in the world.
Roden was born in 1840 into a middle-class family in Paris. August Roden was the second son of the Jean Baptiste Roden-Mary Schaefer couple. Kunjurodan started painting at the age of 10. Between the ages of 14 and 17, he began his apprenticeship at the Petita Ecol School of Art. Rodon's main subject was painting. It was at this school that Roden first met Julius Dallow and Alphonse Legros.
