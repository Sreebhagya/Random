An ornithological map is an ornithological map that can provide detailed information on the number of birds, their distribution, abundance, distribution, long-term change, and changes in the order of the birds according to the seasons. Volunteers accurately study and map the terrain of an area through systematic systems, such as the number of birds and their distribution. These studies will continue in the future and the results will be comparable. The bird map usually shows fluctuations in the number and presence of birds, as well as climatic variations and climatic indications.
Although many bird maps differ in their methodology, they always include spatial and temporal factors. 
A typical bird map project is a method of collecting information on the presence of birds in a given area over a period of time, such as an increase in their numbers, and recording them on a map. Details of the efforts of other initiatives, such as the Bird Breeding Survey, are often recorded on bird maps and incorporated into maps.
The bird map of Kerala is prepared under the guidance of volunteer bird watchers of Kerala, the Kerala Forest Department, the Indian Bird Conservation Network and other organizations. Kerala is the first state in India to produce a bird map. The bird mapping efforts of Kerala started with the experience of Mysore City Bird Atlas. The data collection of Thrissur and Alappuzha was completed in the first year. It will be completed by 2020 with other districts. Bird mapping is done by conducting a 1 hour survey in two different seasons in sub-cells in more than 3000 areas in Kerala covering an area of ​​38,000 sq km.
