The Changiri tree or killer tree is a tree found in the Khmer Rouge massacre in Cambodia. The children and infants of the accused people against Khmer Rouge were beaten to death on this tree. This was done so that the children would not retaliate for killing their parents when they grew up. In doing so, the soldiers would have been blown away, or they would have been victims, thinking they were sympathetic to these children.
