The London Eye is the largest observatory in the world. It is located on the banks of the River Thames in London.
Its height is 135 meters. If the atmosphere is clear, it can be seen from a distance of 45 km. The 32 capsule-shaped chambers are all refrigerated. Each room is designed to seat up to 25 people. This wheel, which spins at a speed of 900 meters per hour, completes one spin in thirty minutes. It usually does not stop people from climbing because of this rotation at low speeds; It is common for people to climb into it while spinning.
Unlike a standard observer, the London Eye has a 360 degree viewing environment. It was inaugurated on December 31, 1999 at 8 pm, hence the name Millennium Wheel. The fee for a one-time visit is Rs 1,200, but it is visited by 35 lakh people every year
