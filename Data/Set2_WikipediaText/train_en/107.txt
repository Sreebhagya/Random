Tachycardia is a condition in which the heart rate increases. The heart beats faster due to heart disease and the natural response to exercise and stress. It is estimated that the heart of an adult beats 60-100 times per second. Tachycardia is a condition that rises more than a hundred times. The heart beats faster during exercise to allow more blood to flow to the muscles. Tachycardia can occur in fever, heart disease, and hyperthyroidism, even when the body is at rest. Excessive use of caffeine can also cause heart palpitations due to side effects of certain medications.
It is normal for tachycardia to be accompanied by rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath and dizziness. There is also a risk of heart attack and bleeding due to shortness of breath.
