Satakarni I was the third of the Satavahana kings. Satakarni dates back to around BC. Central India was ruled in 180.
Although he ruled for only two years, Satakarni defeated the Sungars and conquered the western Malwa region of Anoop and Vidarbha.
In the Hathigumfa inscriptions at Kalinga, Satakarni is depicted as Kharavelan's opponent:
Satakarni carried out two assassinations to declare his power. 
Satakarni's wife was Naganika of the family. The Naneghat inscriptions were written by Naganika. In it they describe Satakarni as the lord of the southern path and the ruler of the unstoppable wheel of power.
It is possible that Satakarni was killed in the battle. After Satakarni, his sons Vedistri and Satisistri came to power.
