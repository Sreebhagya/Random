Kaki Dam is a dam built on the Kaki River, a tributary of the Pampana River in the Ranni Forest in the Seethathodu Grama Panchayat, Pathanamthitta District, Kerala. It was built in 1966 as part of the Sabarigiri Hydroelectric Project. The water sources of this dam are water from Pampa Dam and Kaki River. The water is pumped from the Pampa Dam to Kaki through a 3.21 km long underground tunnel. The dam is 336 m long and 116 m high and is located at an elevation of 981.45 m above sea level. The Anathodu Dam has been constructed as a side dam to prevent the water from flowing through the hills. The water stored in the Kaki-Ananthodu dams is conveyed to the Sabarigiri Power House through penstock pipes.
The Sabarigiri Hydroelectric Project generates 300 MW of electricity using 6 turbines of 50 MW each year. The annual output is 1338 MU.
