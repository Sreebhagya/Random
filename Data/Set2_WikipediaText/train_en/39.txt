The mouse is a handheld pointing device and input device for computers. It is a small device designed to fit in the palm of your hand and has one or more buttons. It is placed on a flat surface. At the bottom of the mouse is a device that determines its movement relative to the flat surface. The movement of the mouse is interpreted as the movement of a point on the display.
It got its name from the fact that the wire from the early mice to the computer resembled the tail of a mouse. Also, the movement of the pointer may be similar to that of a mouse.
The computer mouse was invented in 1967 by Douglas Engelbert. 
The wireless mouse is quite different from ordinary mice in that the wire connecting the computer and the mouse is not visible. Alternatively there is a wireless system, which will have a limit. The mouse can work by sitting within this range.
