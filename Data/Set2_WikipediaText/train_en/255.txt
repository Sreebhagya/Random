Meditation is worship that is performed without concentration, concentrating on the same subject. Those who practice it describe it as the state in which the senses are freed from worldly matters, the mind is completely subdued, the mind is concentrated, and by constant meditation, the mind and the senses are elevated to the highest level of bliss, fixed on the goal of self-realization.
The sages describe it as a truth-seeker. The English word meditation is derived from the Latin word meditari, meaning meditation. It means deep continuous contemplation or careful abode in any one thought. The simple meaning of this is to think and concentrate in the mind or to constantly think only about one thing. Meditation is also a step in yoga.
