The jawbone is the respiratory organ of aquatic organisms. Fragments help to receive oxygen from the water and release carbon dioxide. Some species are able to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere, even if their cheeks are wet.
In animals with gums, the gums can be found inside or outside the body. The jaws of fish are inside them but in some organisms they are on the outside.
