Punjabi folk religion divides the universe into three regions. 
The world of God is inhabited by gods, saints and spirits. It is believed that both spirits and spirits can become gods.
Jatheras are shrines that are built to pay homage to the departed souls and to commemorate them. When the founder of a village dies, a place of worship is established for him in the suburbs of that village. There are many such places of worship in the same village where the Vanni-Jandh-tree is planted nearby. Jatheras are given the nickname of the founder of the village or the name of the village.
