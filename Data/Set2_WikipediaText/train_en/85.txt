Grafting has been used by farmers since ancient times. B.C. It can be seen that the Chinese have adopted this method since 1000. Aristotle in his book described the grafting method of plants.
In the running method, the stems of two plants are grafted together to form a new plant. Therefore, this method can also be called peak integration or compaction. In this method a small branch with more than one bud of the superior variety is selected. This peak is called Ottukampu. The rooted plants for grafting this stalk are called rootstocks.
The woody skin from the stem and graft is cut into the same shape and then joined together to form a tissue. As the stock adheres to the zion, the zion receives the water and food that the roots of the stock absorb. Thus the process of grafting the stems of two types of plants together is called running and the plant obtained from it is called grafted. Running is done by grafting only one bud. This process is called budding.
