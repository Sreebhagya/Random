Colors of the Mountain is a Spanish film that captures the beauty of rural life in the Colombian Mountains. Director Carlos Cesar Arbales has vividly portrayed the lives and dreams of three young children, Manuel, Julian and Pocalus, as they try to catch a ball trapped in a guerrilla landmine while playing football.
The background is a border village in the Colombian mountains of Lombardy. The film depicts the life of nine - year - old Manuel and his friends during the conflict. Their lives are unbearable between the guerrillas in the mountains and the government army. There are only a few people left in that village. Many fled. The school was locked up for fear of guerrilla fighters. One day a new teacher named Carmen comes from the city. Manuel and friends get back to school. His mother tells his father that he can go somewhere and escape, but he is not ready to leave his livestock and farm. One day, Manuel's father gives him a ball as a birthday present. During the game, it crashes into a nearby hill. The guerrillas have planted mines all over the swamp. Manuel and his friends then try to get his ball back.
