Parliamentary democracy is the system of government in which the power to legislate is vested in a House of Representatives. Similarly, the power of action of the executive branch of government also comes from the House of Representatives. Similarly, in this system, the executive branch is obliged to give justification to the House of Representatives for their actions. In this system, the head of state and the head of state are not the same person. In India, the head of state is the President and the head of state is the Prime Minister. In a constitutional monarchy, the head of state is the emperor, king, or queen, e.g., Japan, United Kingdom
