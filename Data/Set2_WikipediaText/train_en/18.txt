The belief that there is only one God is called monotheism in theology. Monotheism plays an important role in the beliefs of the Semitic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Polytheism is the opposite of faith.
Religions that practice monotheism may assign multiple forms to one God. An example of this is the Christian trinity, in which there is only one God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But the unity of God in all forms is fundamental in Judaism, Islam, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
