Hakeem Asanullah Khan was the prime minister and private physician of the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar. An intelligent, cunning, educated and cultured man, he was Zafar's most loyal. Opponents called him a Gangaram Jew.
Although he was not on good terms with Zafar's wife, Zafar's mistress in the early days, during the riots of 1857, the two came together to take a stand against the rebels. After the sepoys discovered Asanullah Khan's correspondence with the British, they tried to kill him, but Zafar defended him. He urged Zafar not to side with the rebels and to surrender to the British. But after Zafar's surrender, Hakeem betrayed the British by giving evidence against Zafar to pardon him. Thomas Metcalfe, a resident of Delhi, died of poisoning in 1853, and it was suspected that Assange Khan was involved.
Asanullah Khan was a contemporary and friend of famous poets such as Mirza Ghalib, Souk and Momin. Poems written by Momin were published by Asanullah Khan under the name Inshai Momin. He also published the poems of Ghalib and Souk.
Asanullah Khan was of Afghan descent. His ancestors migrated from Herat, Afghanistan to the Dal Lake area of ​​Kashmir and later to Delhi. Like Khan, his father and grandfather were Hakeems, as was his son Ikramullah Khan.
There is a family house of Asanullah Khan in the Lal Kua area of ​​Purani Delhi. The palace is called Haveli Mahmooda Un Nisa. It is named after Mehmooda, the wife of Ikramullah Khan. The mansion was built in the 1730s or earlier.
