The peoples who existed in India during the Vedic period are called Janapadas. The kings who made great sacrifices during this time were known as the King of the Peoples, rather than the King of the People. Janapadam literally means the land where the people set foot.
It is believed that the political system of ancient India originated from the semi-primitive tribes known as the Janah. The early scriptures refer to many 'peoples' of the Aryans. They lived in a semi-primitive tribal system and fought with other non-Aryan tribes for cows, sheep and pastures. These early Vedic peoples later came together to form epic folktales.
In the populace, people lived in huts. They raised livestock and other animals. Rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard were cultivated. They also made pottery.
B.C.E. By the sixth century, some tribes had gained more prominence than others. These were known as Mahajanapadas. Most Mahajanapadas are formed around a capital city. Most of the capitals were fortified with wood, stone and brick. The Mahajanapadas mobilized the army and collected taxes from the people. The practice of plowing the land with iron plows instead of wood also developed during this period.
