Taxodonta is a genus of double-armed animals in the subspecies Lamellibronchia. They are characterized by a sequence in which many teeth and rates are alternately aligned, similar to the dentition of the shields. The main genus of this genus is the box-shaped double-tailed cockroach Arca and Barbasia anadara. All of these have thick shields that look rough or twisted. The bark is covered with spherical aria. The Philbranch species of gills of taxodontas are advanced. These are transformed into double layers of organs that process food. Oshta tangents act as complex sorting surfaces.
Taxodonta have a very close relationship with real seaweed or green mussels belonging to the genus Methylaceae. Like green oysters, taxodontas are marine. The interrelationship between these is also widely accepted. This is most evident in the cilia arrangement in the gills and the bundle structure that connects the mussel to the external material. They bear a striking resemblance to Protobranch twins in the dentition and some other structural features that connect the shields. For this reason, in the past, taxodontas were classified as protobranchs. But experts say such similarities are purely external. It is for this reason that the taxodontas are now classified as a genus with sufficient features of the true Lamellibranch subspecies.
