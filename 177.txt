Birth and death registration in India today was started by the British. In the second half of the 19th century, Indians began to use registration laws for British people in many cities. In 1872, a complete law was enacted in the province of Bengal. Later, in 1876, the then British government enacted a law for the registration of births, deaths and marriages. This law allowed the existing laws to continue in each place. Registration was not mandatory under this Act. The Madras Presidency Act, enacted in 1899, made birth and death registration compulsory in the Madras Presidency.
The Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1969 was passed by Parliament as a result of discussions on making a law for this purpose after India became independent. In 1970, it came into existence in most parts of India. Birth and death registration programs are overseen by the Registrar General under the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Central Government. The Census of India also maintains the same office.
The following are some important provisions of the Birth and Death Registration Act.
The Registrar General has issued guidelines, as directed by the Supreme Court, on how to register the birth of an adopted child, though not within the scope of this Act.
