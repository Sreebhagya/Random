According to Hindu beliefs, Lord Sakshal Mahavishnu or Srihari Adinarayana is the mediator and chief of the three deities. ' Devotees see Lord Vishnu as the God who takes care of all affairs and as the Savior "Paramatma", "Parabrahma", "Adi Virat Purusha", "Brahmandanathan" and "Sarvesvara". The word Mahavishnu means "one who is omnipresent" and "one who knows everything". The word "Adi" is because God is the cause of everything in the beginning; Mahavishnu is also known as "Narayanan" which means "God whom man can depend on". Among the three attributes, Mahavishnu is said to be the Sattva.
Vaishnavism sees Parabrahma as Adinarayana / Mahavishnu. Devotees believe that Lord Vishnu has the form of Virat, which is a combination of the three, and is Sarveshwaran or Parabrahman. The Vishnu Purana also records that the trinity originated from the sattvic, rajasic and tamasic qualities of the Parabrahma Adinarayana. These are the three qualities. There are many incarnations of Lord Vishnu in the Puranas. Of these, ten incarnations are considered important. Although not of great importance in the Vedas and other Puranas, it is mentioned in the Puranas as focusing on Lord Vishnu. Vaishnavism believes that all the deities, including the trinity, inhabit Adinarayana and the entire universe, as all the deities are descended from the true Parabrahman, Adinarayana. Adinarayana himself, the Parabrahma deity, performs the five functions of creation, condition, destruction, blessing and disappearance. That is, the devotees see that the beginning and the end of everything are in the real Adinarayana Mahavishnu. Mahalakshmi, the primordial goddess of wealth, is considered to be the wife of Goddess Aishwarya as she needs prosperity for survival. He has thousands of names including Paramatman, Parabrahman, Govindan, Vasudevan, Achuthan, Loknathan, Sarveshwaran and Maheshwaran. The mantras are "Om Namo Narayana, Om Namo Bhagavathe Vasudevaya".

The word Vishnu is derived from the word for step. The word Vishnu is derived from the root word vish, which means step, spread and become active.
There are many myths about Vishnu in history. The Hindu belief is that Vishnu is a god. Many kings built and worshiped the temple of Vishnu.
In the Rig Vedas he appears as the helper of Indra, the chief deity of the gods. Nowhere in the Rig Veda is it mentioned that he is the ideal comrade of Indra, the giver of karma; Elsewhere it is stated that Vishnu is able to follow in the footsteps of Indra. The Rig Veda states that Vishnu wears the earth and Dwya and all the worlds with Swatma, and that Vishnu will not afflict those who praise Him, and that he is the cause of happiness through wealth, disease, and offspring.
It is said that Vishnu created the three worlds with three steps. That is how the name Trivikraman came to be.
The Brahmins were written a few centuries after the writing of the Rig Veda. But in the Brahmins, Vishnu is mentioned in a different way. Vishnu, the Adityatma, does not give much importance to the Brahmins. Instead, it highlights the connection between Vishnu and the Yajnas. The Taithiriyam says that Vishnu himself is the Yajna.
During the Vedic period, Vishnu was an insignificant deity and Indra was the main deity worshiped at that time. Vishnu, on the other hand, represented Aditya and Urvaratha. BCE By the 2nd century, Vishnu began to be associated with the then Dravidian goddess Narayanan. They came to be known as Narayana-Vishnu. Narayanan, the avaidika deity, was called Bhagavad-gita and the worshipers were called Bhagavad-gita. Bhagwati was Bhagwati's wife. Bhagwati, on the other hand, represented the mother or creation. These two goddesses were similar to the tribal chiefs of the Anaryans. It was believed that Narayanan would pour goodwill on his devotees just as the chief of the tribe would receive views from his relatives and distribute his share among the relatives. As Vishnu and Narayana began to be seen together, Vishnu gained prominence from the hitherto insignificant worship. The number of devotees increased as the devotees of Vishnu and Narayana were brought under one umbrella. The Vedic deity Vishnu and the non-Vedic deity Narayanan merged with each other and merged with other deities.
The next was a combination of Krishna and Vasudev, an adventurous and valiant tribal leader from the Vrishni tribe of western India. The great epic Mahabharata was later rearranged to show that Krishna, Vishnu and all other deities are one. Thus, before 200 BC, three types of devotees and their gods became identified. This marked the beginning of Bhagavata worship or Vaishnava worship.
Devotion and non-violence are the hallmarks of Vaishnavism. Devotion is loving submission. It is the kind of loyalty that a tribal man shows to his chief or a citizen to his king. Non-violence, on the other hand, was conducive to agrarian society. It was advised not to torture animals. Animals were tortured by the tribes for sacrifice and by the Aryans for yajnas. Vaishnavism hated it. Both were in tune with the old life-giving cult. The people worshiped the idol of Vishnu and offered rice and sesame to it.
The Dashavatara stories in Bhagavad Gita are incarnations of Lord Vishnu. The ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu are as follows. There is an argument that there were seven incarnations at first and the rest came later.
