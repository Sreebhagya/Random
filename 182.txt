Dystrophism is the movement of the earth as a result of a translational phenomenon. Dystrophism also involves the formation of continents, seabeds, plateaus, and mountain ranges. Definition of the geographical features of the Cordilleran territory. W. The term diastrophism was coined by the geologist Powell. Powell's colleague J.M. K. Gilbert classifies diastrophism into two:
Diastrophism is a continuous phenomenon that deforms the earth's surface. Modern movements in unstable regions can cause major earthquakes and significant changes in the earth's surface. Dystrophism is exemplified by the rise of sediments deposited on the ocean floor during the post-ice age geological period. Strong diastrophic activity can lead to volcanism and eruption. The underlying cause of dystrophy is still unknown.
