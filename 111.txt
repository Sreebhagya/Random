Owners and others believe that Rice's portrait may have been painted by Oasis Humphrey in 1788 or 1789 when Austen was 13 years old. Experts at the National Portrait Gallery oppose this claim. They argue that this is not the way Humphrey's painting of the early nineteenth century could have belonged to Austin.
The Rice Portrait is believed to be a portrait of Oasis Humphrey, modeled on 13 - year - old Austen, among many others from 1788-89. The illustration was originally thought to have been mistakenly painted by Johannes Sophane, but now its supporters believe it was painted by Ojias Humphrey. It is believed that Francis Austen knew Humphrey and painted a portrait of Francis Austen in 1780. The painting is now housed in the Sheffield Graves Gallery. William Humphrey, brother of Ozias Humphrey, was vicar of Kemsing. They lived near Francis Austen's house in Sevenocks. Also, Jane was Austen's father's unborn brother and a neighbor.
